Totally got sidetracked (with joy!) by the news of a Girl‚Äôs Day visit - so I ditched the plan and whipped up a playful little welcome site instead. üíª‚ú®

**Intention**: Flex some tasteful CSS magic.

**Reality**: Spiraled into a rabbit hole of questionable creative choices and entirely-too-much fun.

Apart from literally [branching out](bash_customization/bashrc.md).

What else is new? üòé‚ú®

#### preface:

> So, _accidentally_, I found myself listening to my ever-inspiring colleague **[@Cagatay](https://github.com/CagatayWT)** this morning, who casually mentioned the possible visit of his daughter to our Web Dev class for Girl¬¥s Day.

> Naturally, that little spark of news sent my concentration straight out the window - because honestly, how are you supposed to focus on JavaScript when a curious, future tech-talent is suddenly sitting in class for Girls‚Äô Day?

> So yes, the final project took a tiny detour‚Ä¶ but hey, offering a warm, slightly over-engineered digital welcome felt like the right kind of code deployment at the time.

> Instead of sticking to a structured, responsible-adult kind of plan, I took the scenic route: throwing together a little ‚Äúwelcome site‚Äù for the occasion. Something cheerful and a bit playful - to greet our guest with a smile, and help her feel at home in our wonderfully encouraging, sneakily brilliant, and delightfully inspring crew of future coding legends.
